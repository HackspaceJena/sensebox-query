* sensebox-query

A little Bash script for querying the Sensebox installed at Krautspace.

There are still some things to do, feel free to contribute code to solve
these issues.

*TODO:*
- make output to shell prettier
  - use conditional coloring, e.g. cold -> blue, warm -> red
  - use ASCII art
  - format date
- deal with errors
  - curl might not be installed
  - curl might fail (e.g. no connection)
  - grep might not find anything
